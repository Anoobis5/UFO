## Project Overview
For this project, our client has asked us to modify a webpage and dynamic table so that it may provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings across multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results

Upon opening the webpage, our client will see the title with a pictured background at the top. When we scroll down, we see the header and text our client asked us to include. Beneath that, we can see our filters and all the data in a dynamic table. Please see below for a screenshot of the 2nd section of the webpage:

The initial web page provided 2 search criteria, with Filter buttons, allowing the user to filter based on either criteria. We refactored our HTML code, to remove the buttons so that once the user presses 'Enter' on their keyboard, the webpage will filter based on the total input criteria. Looking at our updated webpage, we can see that we have inluded 5 different filters to choose from for the data: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. We modified the code, so that users can choose any of these filters, and the webpage will provide any and all data specific to the input search criteria. Please see below for examples of filtered searches:


*Search by single criterion:*

*Search by multiple criterion:*

In the example above, we can see that but filling in multiple criteria, we can narrow dow our data from just instances occuring on 1/13/2010, to more specific criteria (occurences on 'Date' 1/13/2010, in 'City' white oak, in 'State' pa, in 'Country' us, in a triangle 'Shape'). You can fill all the criteria to fill your searches, or just a few to collect the data that you require. In the example screenshot below, we see that we have filter the data by Date (1//11/2010) and by Country (us), to give us filtered data for our needs.

## Project Summary

Per our client's request, we have created a clean and functional webpage to filter through different criteria
