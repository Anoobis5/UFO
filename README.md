## Project Overview
For this project, our client has asked us to modify a webpage and dynamic table so that it may provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings across multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results

Upon opening the webpage, our client will see the title with a pictured background at the top. When we scroll down, we see the header and text our client asked us to include. Beneath that, we can see our filters and all the data in a dynamic table. Please see below for a screenshot of the 2nd section of the webpage:

The initial web page provided 2 search criteria, with Filter buttons, allowing the user to filter based on either criteria. We refactored our HTML code, to remove the buttons so that once the user presses 'Enter' on their keyboard, the webpage will filter based on the total input criteria. Looking at our updated webpage, we have inluded 5 different filters to choose from for the data: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. We modified the code, so that users can chooce any of these filters, and the webpage will provide any and all data specific to the input search criteria. Please see below for examples of filtered searches:


*Search by single criterion:*
